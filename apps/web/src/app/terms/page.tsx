            </h2>
            <p>
              Verzus Arena operates exclusively as an esports platform hosting contests governed by the <strong>Predominance Test</strong>.
              Match outcomes depend predominantly upon the physical dexterity, reaction speed, strategic decision-making, game knowledge,
              and execution of the competing players.
            </p>
            <p>
              Games of chance, lotteries, slots, roulette, dice, and house-banked games are strictly barred from the Platform catalog.
              Verzus Arena does not offer house odds, act as a bookmaker, or wager against players. Prize pools are funded by participant
              entry fees, and administrative contest facilitation fees are fixed and non-contingent upon match outcomes.

              <span>Proprietary Automated Match Verification & Video Telemetry</span>
            </h2>
            <p>
              To eliminate the necessity of developer API integrations, manual screenshot uploads, and delayed disputes, the Platform
              employs proprietary automated visual verification technology and video telemetry ingestion.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
              <li>
                <strong>Ephemeral Volatile Analysis:</strong> Game feeds, scoreboard regions, and HUD elements captured during active
                matches are analyzed transiently in volatile system memory. Raw video streams are never permanently recorded or stored on disk.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Proprietary Technology Protections:</strong> All visual verification engines, mathematical algorithms, detection models,
                and validation architectures are strictly proprietary trade secrets of Verzus Arena. No licenses, technical schematics,
                or blueprints are granted to players or third parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Display Integrity:</strong> Participants are required to maintain clear, unobstructed visibility of the designated
                in-game scoreboard and gamertag during competitive match sessions. Obscuring, modifying, or cropping HUD elements constitutes
                a match violation.

                <strong>Practice Demo Coins:</strong> Complimentary tokens intended strictly for skill training and tournament rehearsals.
                Practice coins have zero fiat currency value and cannot be exchanged, withdrawn, or transferred for real currency.

              <li>
                <strong>Contest Escrow Vault:</strong> When you enter a cash match or tournament, your entry fee is locked in a secure

                to the victor&apos;s available balance.

              <li>
                <strong>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 1x Rollover Invariant:</strong> To prevent payment fraud, stolen credit card abuse,
                and money laundering, all deposited cash funds must be wagered at least once (1x rollover) in competitive matches before
                becoming eligible for withdrawal. Net winnings resulting from completed matches are immediately withdrawable.
              </li>

              Players have a window of fifteen (15) minutes post-match to file an official dispute ticket with accompanying context.
