# Legal Analysis & Jurisdictional Framework (LEGAL.md)

This document outlines the legal classification of Antigravity as a **skill-based competitive platform** distinct from games of chance or gambling.

## ⚖️ The Skill vs. Chance Doctrine

Under international jurisprudence (including common law precedents in the US, UK, and Commonwealth jurisdictions), gambling requires the conjunction of three elements:
1. **Prize** (monetary or valuable consideration awarded to the winner).
2. **Consideration** (entry fee or stake paid to participate).
3. **Chance** (the outcome is determined primarily or predominantly by luck or randomness).

### The Predominance Test
Antigravity operates strictly on games governed by the **Predominance Test**:
- The outcome of competitions (e.g. highest score, lowest time, fighting game rounds) is governed predominantly by physical dexterity, reaction speed, strategic decision-making, and game mastery.
- Random number generation (RNG) elements in eligible games must not outweigh player skill over a standard competition duration.
- Games governed predominantly by chance (roulette, slots, dice, bingo, card lotteries) are strictly prohibited from registration in the Game Profile directory.

## 🇰🇪 Kenyan Legal & Regulatory Framework

### 1. Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB)
- **Governing Law**: Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act (Cap 131, Laws of Kenya).
- **Statutory Scope**: Regulates betting (wagering on uncertain future events like sports matches) and lotteries/gaming (games of chance).
- **Esports Exemption Rationale**: Genuine contests of skill where participants compete directly against one another for prizes do not meet the statutory definition of gaming under Cap 131, provided no house odds are offered and entry fees fund direct prize pools or platform administration fees.
- **Demo Mode**: Because Antigravity operates in `WALLET_MODE=demo` (POINTS have no cash value and cannot be converted to KES), no gaming license is required during initial rollout.

### 2. Kenya Data Protection Act (2019)
- **Principle of Minimization**: Antigravity enforces a strict **Zero Permanent Screenshot Storage Policy**. Match frames captured by the player are analyzed transiently in volatile client/server memory. Only SHA-256 hashes and alphanumeric score strings are persisted.
- **Consent**: Explicit terms of service agree to OCR scanning of screen regions during active match sessions.

### 3. Consumer Protection Act (2012)
- Transparent match rules and deterministic scoring engines ensure clear, unmanipulated outcomes.
- Mandatory audit logs and dispute resolution procedures via Human-in-the-Loop review satisfy fairness standards.

## 🛡️ Anti-Cheat & Fair Play Compliance

To maintain legitimacy as a pure skill platform, Antigravity implements:
- Rate limit thresholds on score increments.
- Optical bounding box verification preventing edited screen insertions.
- Hardware/device fingerprinting to prevent multi-accounting.
- Automated forfeiture of entry fees and banishment for users caught tampering with OCR feeds.
